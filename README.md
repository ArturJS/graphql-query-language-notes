## About

This repo contains notes from [Eve Porcello](https://twitter.com/eveporcello)'s [GraphQL Query Language course](https://egghead.io/courses/graphql-query-language).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and my personal take on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.

## Course Goal
